## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I failed finishing this challenge many times, never get it right. And I do learned more this time. How to properly color overlay the image, the responsiveness of the page (even is not perfect though).

This is my 5th attempt of creating this component card, and this time it's done, just hope I've done enough.

### Continued development

Lot's of things need improvement, and I planned doing more like this project in the future to make sure I can use it everytime I need.
